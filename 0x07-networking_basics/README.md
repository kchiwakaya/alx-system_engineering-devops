What it is
How many layers it has
How it is organized
What is a LAN
Typical usage
Typical geographical size
What is a WAN
Typical usage
Typical geographical size
What is the Internet
What is an IP address
What are the 2 types of IP address
What is localhost
What is a subnet
Why IPv6 was created
TCP/UDP
What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema)
What is the main difference between TCP and UDP
What is a port
Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers
What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network
### Tasks
0. OSI model
mandatory
OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The idea is to segregate the different parts of what make communication possible.

It is organized from the lowest level to the highest level:

The lowest level: layer 1 which is for transmission on physical layers with electrical impulse, light or radio signal
The highest level: layer 7 which is for application specific communication like SNMP for emails, HTTP for your web browser, etc
Keep in mind that the OSI model is a concept, it’s not even tangible. The OSI model doesn’t perform any functions in the networking process. It is a conceptual framework so we can better understand complex interactions that are happening. Most of the functionality in the OSI model exists in all communications systems.

### LAN connect local devices together, WAN connects LANs together, and WANs are operating over the Internet.

Questions:

What type of network a computer in local is connected to?

Internet
WAN
LAN
What type of network could connect an office in one building to another office in a building a few streets away?

Internet
WAN
LAN
What network do you use when you browse www.google.com from your smartphone (not connected to the Wifi)?

Internet
WAN
LAN
### 2. MAC and IP address
mandatory


Questions:

What is a MAC address?

The name of a network interface
The unique identifier of a network interface
A network interface
What is an IP address?

Is to devices connected to a network what postal address is to houses
The unique identifier of a network interface
Is a number that network devices use to connect to networks
### Let’s fill the empty parts in the drawing above.

Questions:

Which statement is correct for the TCP box:
It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely
It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process
Which statement is correct for the UDP box:
It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely
It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might loss data along in the process
Which statement is correct for the TCP worker:
Have you received boxes x, y, z?
May I increase the rate at which I am sending you boxes?

### 4. TCP and UDP ports
mandatory
Once packets have been sent to the right network device using IP using either UDP or TCP as a mode of transportation, it needs to actually enter the network device.

If we continue the comparison of a network device to your house, where IP address is like your postal address, UDP and TCP ports are like the windows and doors of your place. A TCP/UDP network device has 65535 ports. Some of them are officially reserved for a specific usage, some of them are known to be used for a specific usage (but nothing is officially declared) and the rest are free of use.

While the full list of ports should not be memorized, it is important to know the most used ports, let’s start by remembering 3 of them:

22 for SSH
80 for HTTP
443 for HTTPS
Note that a specific IP + port = socket.

Write a Bash script that displays listening ports:

That only shows listening sockets
That shows the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs
Example:
